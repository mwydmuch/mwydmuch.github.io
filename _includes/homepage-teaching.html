            <p>As part of my PhD/being an assistant, I taught/teach a few courses at Poznan University of Technology (PUT) related to the topics of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Big Data:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Advanced Methods of Computational Intelligence 2021, 2022 and 2023 (lectures + exercises)</strong><br>
                based on
                <i>Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto, Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction</i>
                and selected chapters from
                <i>Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach</i>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Methods of Artificial and Computational Intelligence 2021 (exercises)</strong><br>
                based on selected chapters from
                <i>Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach</i>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Big Data Processing 2019/2020 and Processing of Massive Datasets 2018/2019 (exercises)</strong><br>
                based on selected chapters from
