            <h3>Teaching</h3>
            As part of my PhD, I teach/teached a few courses at Poznan University of Technology (PUT) related to the topics of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science and Big Data:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Advanced Methods of Computational Intelligence 2021, 2022 and 2023 (lectures + exercises)</strong><br>
                based on
                <i>Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto, Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction</i>
                and selected chapters from
                <i>Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach</i>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Methods of Artificial and Computational Intelligence 2021 (exercises)</strong><br>
                based on selected chapters from
                <i>Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach</i>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Big Data Processing 2019/2020 and Processing of Massive Datasets 2018/2019 (exercises)</strong><br>
                based on selected chapters from
                <i>Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, Jeff Ullman, Mining of Massive Datasets</i>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Information Theory and Lossless Compression Methods 2018 (exercises)</strong><br>
                based on the first chapters from
                <i>David J.C. MacKay, Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms</i>.<br>
                Note: <span class="reverse-second"><i class="fa fa-award"></i>&nbsp;The course was awarded as the best new course in 2018 at the Institute of Computer Science.</span>
            </li>
            </ul>
